# GlobusOS

> AI-native operating system and userspace platform built on the ShivaCore kernel.

**Project:** `globus-os`  
**Organization:** `A-TownChain-Okosystems`  
**Status:** `development`  
**Version:** `0.1.0`  
**License:** `Apache-2.0`

## System role

GlobusOS is the complete operating-system userspace/platform layer above **ShivaCore**. ShivaCore remains the reusable kernel/TCB; GlobusOS provides the system services, device integration, storage, networking, graphics, audio, package lifecycle, identity, wallet integration and recovery required to turn the kernel into an operating system.

The complete standard OS component coverage and implementation priorities are defined in [`docs/OS_STANDARD_COMPONENTS.md`](docs/OS_STANDARD_COMPONENTS.md). That document is a coverage baseline, not a claim that every listed component is already production-ready.

```text
Applications
    ↓
Aurora AI / Desktop / Shell
    ↓
GlobusOS system services
    ├─ Identity / Authentication
    ├─ Wallet Service boundary
    ├─ Storage / VFS
    ├─ Network / Devices
    └─ Package / Update / Recovery
    ↓
IPC + capabilities
    ↓
ShivaCore kernel / TCB
    ↓
HAL / firmware / hardware
```

AI and blockchain components are not promoted into the ShivaCore TCB by integration.

## Identity & wallet

GlobusOS uses a native **Boot → Login/Register → Identity → Wallet → Desktop** flow. Creating a new user profile provisions an A-TownChain-compatible wallet identity through the dedicated wallet integration. The public wallet address is bound to the GlobusOS User ID through a cryptographically verifiable identity binding.

The wallet's 24-word recovery phrase is **recovery material, not the daily login credential**. Private keys and recovery material remain behind protected local boundaries and are never exposed to ordinary applications, Aurora AI, telemetry, logs, GitHub, or remote services.

See [`docs/IDENTITY_WALLET_ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/IDENTITY_WALLET_ARCHITECTURE.md) and [`docs/IDENTITY_WALLET_FLOW.md`](docs/IDENTITY_WALLET_FLOW.md).

## Implemented system foundation

The repository now contains a Rust workspace under `system/` with explicit subsystem boundaries:

- `globus-system-core` — lifecycle and kernel-facing identity.
- `globus-ipc` — endpoints and IPC messages.
- `globus-security` — deny-by-default capability authorization.
- `globus-process` — process/thread lifecycle.
- `globus-memory` — address-space and page policy.
- `globus-vfs` — filesystem namespace and mount contract.
- `globus-net` — network policy/socket boundary.
- `globus-devices` — isolated device/driver registry.
- `globus-services` — service lifecycle and dependency ordering.
- `globus-graphics` — display/compositor/GPU boundary.
- `globus-audio` — audio service boundary.
- `globus-package` — signed package metadata verification.
- `globus-update` — atomic A/B update and rollback state machine.
- `globus-runtime` — integrated userspace runtime.
- `system/identity/` — identity, authentication, wallet-binding and recovery integration contract.

These are the canonical foundations. Hardware-specific implementations and production cryptography remain separate, evidence-driven milestones.

## Standard OS component coverage

GlobusOS tracks the standard operating-system domains as an explicit implementation matrix:

- Boot, UEFI, Secure Boot and TPM
- CPU/SMP, interrupts, timers and memory management
- PCI/PCIe, MMIO, DMA and IOMMU
- NVMe/storage, VFS and filesystems
- Ethernet/network stack
- capabilities, authorization, audit and key management
- identity, authentication and sessions
- init/service management and power management
- graphics, GPU and audio
- packages, updates and recovery
- shell/userland and developer SDK
- observability and diagnostics
- Aurora AI integration outside the kernel TCB
- A-TownChain/ATC-VM/ATCLang integration outside the kernel TCB

See [`docs/OS_STANDARD_COMPONENTS.md`](docs/OS_STANDARD_COMPONENTS.md) for ownership, priority, trust boundaries, hardware dependency chains and readiness criteria.

## Boot path

```text
UEFI / firmware
 → bootloader
 → ShivaCore
 → capability + IPC initialization
 → GlobusOS init/service manager
 → identity / security / devices / storage / network
 → wallet integration boundary
 → runtime / graphics / audio
 → Aurora / desktop / applications
```

## Development

```bash
cargo fmt --all -- --check
cargo check --workspace --all-targets
cargo test --workspace --all-targets
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
```

CI runs the same validation gates on pushes and pull requests.

## Architecture and governance

See [`docs/SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md) for the normative system decomposition and trust boundaries and [`docs/OS_STANDARD_COMPONENTS.md`](docs/OS_STANDARD_COMPONENTS.md) for complete OS component coverage. Development follows `ATC-STD-000` and the applicable organization standards. `APPROVED`, `IMPLEMENTED`, `AUDITED` and `PRODUCTION_READY` remain independent states.

## Ecosystem boundaries

```text
ATCLang → ATC-VM → A-TownChain

Aurora → GlobusOS IPC/API → ShivaCore

GlobusOS Identity → atc-wallet integration → A-TownChain identity
```

The VM remains the boundary between chain execution and the Rust system/network track. GlobusOS does not embed chain semantics into the kernel.
